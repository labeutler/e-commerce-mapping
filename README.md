# eCommerce Mapping
Mapping the back end of an e-commerce website and displaying, with video, how the product works.

## Description

Taking the code that was provided and using the previous assignments and Google to assist with completing the items required to make the back end of this project work.  

Using the different tools, Insomnia, MySQL, Express.js and Sequelize packages to complete this has been a new challenge.  I've learned a lot with each of them, so now I'm feeling more comfortable using them. Even the use of the videos for the video walkthroughs.

### User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
